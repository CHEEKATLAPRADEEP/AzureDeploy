### Azure Resource Manager - Demystified

During this hackathon, you take the role as the cloud architect within your company, which is a large ISV who has recently started to use Azure. 
As the trusted advisor, you need to set the scene to ensure your developers and business units have everything they need to leverage Azure in the most efficient way. On top of that, you have a demanding, but very forward leaning CIO who tends to come up with some crazy ideas, followed by a ridiculous deadline.
